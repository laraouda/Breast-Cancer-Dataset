# Breast-Cancer-Dataset
This project demonstrates the implementation of two classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB), for diagnosing breast cancer. The performance of these two models is analyzed and compared to identify the most effective approach.

# Features
Preprocessing and Feature Scaling
The dataset is preprocessed and features are scaled to optimize model performance.
SVM Classification:
Implemented using scikit-learn.
Experimentation with different kernel functions:
